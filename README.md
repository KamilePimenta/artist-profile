# Welcome to Front X
This is a base of a small project that helps Frontend developers to upgrade their hard skills in: `Vue.js`, `JavaScript`, `HTML5` and `CSS3` in beginning but we can introduce anything that we want to learn or practice like `Unit Tests` or `Storybook` (this is an amazing tool to go better your job!).

## Project NÂº 002
This is a landing page for an artist profile that we introduce Ariana Grande like our model. In this project, we use the audio tag to play some songs.

## Project setup
We are using `Vue.js 3`, so if you wanna check out the docs or learn more about it go to [**Introduction to Vue.js 3**](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html). We recommend that you use the Composition API on this job because is a different way to organize your files and start something new (if you aren't doing it yet ^^).
